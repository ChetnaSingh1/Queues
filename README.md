# Queues
##A queue is a useful data structure in programming.
In programming terms, putting an item in the queue is called an "enqueue" and removing an item from the queue is called "dequeue"
It follows First In, First Out(FIFO) or Last In, Last Out(LILO) order.
There are two types of queues- linear and circular.
Enqueue and Dequeue operations are done from two different ends unlike stacks.
Input is done from the rear end and Output is taken from the front end.
